# Advanced CSS

## Tasks

1. Effortless transitions when scrolling
- When scrolling is triggered on the html element itself, weâ€™d like the behavior of the scroll to be as fluid as possible.
```
html {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
  }
```

2. Do you know your color values?
- Add foreground color to something
```
something {
    color: #FFFFFF;
}
```

- select all anchor element with "a"

- select element with class use "." before name.
